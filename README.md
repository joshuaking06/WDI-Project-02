## Overview
React Movie Library is a route-finding app tailored to those looking not just for places to drink, but also for coherent bar-focussed tours through London. The USP is that it allows users to opt into searching specifically for rooftop bars, beer gardens and summer walks between pubs with excellent outdoor terraces.

*Users can upload two types of object:*
1. Their favourite secret haunt or lesser-known pub rooftop;
2. A series of these bars in a particular order to create a coherent route (‘crawl’) through London, which passes through several bars within a theme.

We also created a ‘sunshine mode’ toggle button. In ‘sunshine mode’, bar crawl results are filtered for being comprised of at least 50% outdoor bar space.
